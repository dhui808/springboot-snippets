## Spring Boot 3.5.8 + RestAssured 5.5.0 + WireMock 3.13.2 Example
    Note: Spring Boot 4 has problem with Junit 5.

## TestAssured runs with a dynamic port
    When starting a restassured test, restassured starts the application on a random port.
    The real application can be running at the same time on another port (fixed as specified in application properties).

## RestAssured is not very different from MockMvc
    Probably more powerful.
